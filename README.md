# parsing-online-shop-with-scrapy

This project aims at parsing goods of a widely known online shop of sport goods.

Using the script one can collect the data about bycicles that are being offered by the marketplace. The script collects their names, current/discounted prices and downloads pictures as well. All the data is being collected and written to a CSV file.
